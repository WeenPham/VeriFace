## üìñ Overview

**VeriFace** is a deep learning‚Äìpowered web application built with **Flask** that allows users to **detect** and **generate deepfakes**.  
It provides an intuitive interface for analyzing videos or webcam feeds to identify manipulated content and for creating realistic face swaps.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- üé≠ **Deepfake Detection:** Upload a video or use your webcam to determine if faces in the content are real or manipulated.  
- üß¨ **Deepfake Generation:** Swap faces between a source and target image to create realistic deepfakes.  
- ‚ö° **Real-time Processing:** Detect deepfakes live using your webcam feed.  
- üìπ **Video Analysis:** Analyze uploaded videos and automatically save detection results.

---

## üß© Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10**
- **CUDA (optional)** ‚Äî Recommended for GPU acceleration.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/WeenPham/VeriFace.git
cd VeriFace
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Create Virtual Environment and Install Dependencies

This project requires Python 3.10.

```bash
# --- For Linux/macOS ---
python3.10 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# --- For Windows (PowerShell) ---
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# --- Install the required dependencies ---
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Download Pre-trained Models

Download the pre-trained model weights (`meso_net_epoch_40-50.pth`) and place them in the `app/models/checkpoints/` directory.

**Note:** For optimal performance, especially with real-time processing, run the application on a machine with a GPU and CUDA installed.

---

## üöÄ Usage

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Start the Flask Application

```bash
python -m flask run -p <port-num>
```

This will start the application on `http://localhost:<port-num>`.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Access the Web Interface

Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:<port-num>`.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Explore Features

* **Home Page:** View general information about the project.
* **Detect Page:** Upload an MP4 video or use your webcam to detect deepfakes in real-time.
* **Generate Page:** Upload source and target images (JPEG or PNG) to generate a deepfake image.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ View Results

The application processes your inputs and displays the results on the respective pages.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

* **Webcam Access:** Ensure your browser has permission to access your camera for real-time detection.
* **Supported Formats:**
  * Videos: MP4
  * Images: JPEG, PNG
